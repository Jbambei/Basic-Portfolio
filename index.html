    <p>My name is Joel Bambei. I may be the worst person to ever live at writing about themselves. Even though I have twenty years of experiences and stories (okay maybe only 14 years I can remember for the pedants out there), every time I have to write about myself or describe myself my mind goes blank. Should I talk about how I've moved 13 times? That I hate math? Should I start writing like its an autobiography and start with that I was born in Colorado? Is any of that interesting enough to actually mention? I think it all depends on your audience, but even when I know my audience it is hard to do. So instead, I think I'll resort to writing a slightly sarcastic paragraph about myself and move on to actually creating the website, which is bound to be even tougher than writing about myself. </p>
